# Project Title: Udemy Clone – Educational Platform UI

# Description:

I have developed a front-end clone of the popular online learning platform Udemy, using HTML and CSS with customized animations and responsive design. This project replicates the visual structure and key user interface elements of Udemy, including:

A dynamic homepage featuring a header, search bar, and promotional banners

A course listing section with styled course cards displaying images, titles, ratings, and prices

An interactive navigation bar with dropdown menus

Hover effects and CSS animations for smooth user interaction

A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

This project focuses on front-end design only—no backend or functional course enrollment. It showcases my skills in crafting a clean, intuitive UI and applying modern CSS techniques to enhance user experience.

# Tools & Technologies Used:

HTML5

CSS3

CSS Flexbox & Grid

CSS Transitions & Keyframe Animations

Media Queries for Responsive Design

# Purpose:
To demonstrate my ability to design and animate professional, user-friendly web interfaces while closely replicating a real-world application.
